Das ist Wahr. </span>(We are beggars. That's the truth.) That's the short story about who we are: we were dead and now we live. We were trapped and now we're set free. Not in the least because we've earned it, but only because God loved us. <br></p><p>The slightly longer story may be told by looking at our name:</p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Immanuel </span>- God promised through Isaiah the prophet that the Savior was coming, the Savior who would be Immanuel, God with us (Isaiah 7:14). This is the heart and flesh and blood of who we are: we are united to Christ and through Him, we are with God. Our union with Christ informs and powers everything we do - it's <span style="font-style:italic;">why </span>we can worship God, it's <span style="font-style:italic;">how </span>we can worship God. It's why we are so bold to call others to be with us, not because we are any wiser or stronger or more attractive than others, but because Christ is with us. We chose the name to be a constant reminder of our redemption through Christ and to give us that uniquely Jesus-like mixture of humility and hope. Humility because all that's good in us is from God. Hope because Jesus doesn't lose. His purposes and plans are as certain as the past. <br></p><p>The name Immanuel is also our confession of being Trinitarian, believing there is one God who exists in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. It is the Father to whom we are joined. It is the Son who has made that joining possible by becoming God with us. And it is the Holy Spirit who has accomplished this wonderful union.<br></p><p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Reformed </span>- "Reformed," for us, holds two meanings. First, we are consciously and conscientiously tied to the doctrines reemphasized during the Reformation of the 16th and 17th centuries. These doctrines have often been summarized by the five "solas":</p><ul><li><span style="font-style:italic;">Sola Scriptura</span> - The Scriptures are authoritative and completely trustworthy. It is only in the Bible that we can find and know the salvation God has made through Christ. <br></li><li><span style="font-style:italic;">Sola Christus</span> - Salvation from our sins is available only through the person, life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. <br></li><li><span style="font-style:italic;">Sola Gratia </span>- Salvation from our sins can never be earned, only given. Thus, we are saved by grace alone. Good works testify to our salvation, but have no part in securing that salvation.</li><li><span style="font-style:italic;">Sola Fide</span> - Faith alone is the instrument, the pathway of salvation. It is through faith alone, given by the Holy Spirit, that men and women may be saved.</li><li><span style="font-style:italic;">Soli Deo Gloria</span> - We were made and saved for the glory of God alone. The glory of the Triune God is our greatest passion and we are thoroughly convinced that all of His creation will, more and more, reflect His glory and reign.</li></ul>Being "reformed" also emphasizes our great hope in the plan of God for us. We are so very far from perfect that we could often slip into despair were it not for the promises of Christ to make His church, His bride, beautiful and fit for Him. Jesus is the ultimate reformer - He makes us able to obey, He reshapes and reforms us day after day. And in this ability to obey we are most deeply satisfied. <br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Presbyterian </span>- The Living God is a God of order (1 Cor. 14:40) and His church is to reflect that order. According to His wisdom, Christ, the church's Good Shepherd, has set undershepherds over His flock. The Bible calls these undershepherds elders or presbyters and gives clear instruction on how they are to watch over the flock (1 Pet. 5:1-4). Being led by elected elders makes us presbyterian.<br><br>We believe Christ has ordained for His church to operate this way. But we would be remiss if we neglected to tell you that we love being presbyterian. It means we are freed to follow Christ rather than any one man. It means we are protected from tyranny by the plurality of elders and the presbytery that oversees them. And though imperfect, the leadership and care of the elders are a wonderful, ongoing picture of the Good Shepherd.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Church</span> - The church is the body of Christ, those who have been called out of darkness and into light. By the grace of God alone we have been made part of His people. The Bible calls us His covenant people, those to whom God has bound Himself, promised great promises through the work of Christ. This covenant people is set apart by the covenant seal of baptism and the covenant meal of communion, the Lord's Supper. <br><br>The church exists to worship God, to bear witness to God's truth, to grow in grace and holiness, to minister to the saints, and to minister to the city. <p></p></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="footer"><div id="footer_text">Contact: 765-477-7025 Services: 10 a.m. (Bible class), 11 a.m. (worship), 5:30 p.m. (teaching service)</div></div></div><!-- wfxbuild / 1.0 / layout6-109-1 / 2009-06-26 23:47:15 CEST--></body></html>
