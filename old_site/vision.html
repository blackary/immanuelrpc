This means our highest duty and greatest joy is worshipping our Creator and Redeemer. Nothing we are or do takes precedence over this truth: that we were created and redeemed in order to worship God. <br></p><p>But why are we <span style="font-style:italic;">here </span>- why <span style="font-style:italic;">this </span>church in <span style="font-style:italic;">this city</span>? We're here because we're convinced that the city and the people of West Lafayette belong to their Creator God and that Christ has much glory to gain from expanding His kingdom here. West Lafayette is a college town of close to 30,000, a number which more than doubles during the academic year. It is a city steeped in intellectual prowess and pride—a city that, more than most, has incredible opportunities to reach the whole world. But it’s also a city that lacks a clear, Biblical witness for the doctrines of grace. <br></p><p>While sometimes frustrated with certain prevailing sins, we love West Lafayette and want to see it brought into the service and worship of our King. We trust there are many of God’s elect here and we pray He will use us to gather them into the kingdom. We also believe there are many who are longing for a church that proclaims and practices the Word of God with warmth and clarity and conviction.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="footer"><div id="footer_text">Contact: 765-477-7025 Services: 10 a.m. (Bible class), 11 a.m. (worship), 5:30 p.m. (teaching service)</div></div></div><!-- wfxbuild / 1.0 / layout6-109-1 / 2009-06-26 23:47:15 CEST--></body></html>
